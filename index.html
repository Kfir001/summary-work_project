                    You’re a new startup founder or are working on a new software-driven initiative.
                     A mobile app or a responsive web-app is critical to your vision.
                </p>

                <p>You’re hearing many development companies explain what they do and why they’re the vendor you 
                    should choose; but you’re looking for a partner, not a vendor. We’re here to help. 
                    Designli is the top-rated software firm in the Southeast, with a focus on consulting, design, 
                    development, and post-launch iteration for newly conceptualized apps and websites.
                </p>
           
                <p>Building an app is expensive and time-consuming: know your price points and timelines before 
                    you start. We work to ensure your ‘Version 1’ best addresses your target user-base while 
                    sticking to budget through our SolutionLab blueprinting engagement.Entrepreneurs and 
                    established businesses value our process and its step-by-step approach, helping clients seek 
                    validation, feedback, and - oftentimes - investment.
